                <p class="mb-6">
                    So, this is my first blog.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Why am I writing it? Honestly, I don’t know.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    I just wanted a space to write something.<br>
                    But when I finally created this blog page, I couldn’t figure out what to write.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Isn’t it weird? When you want something, you have so many plans.<br>
                    But when it’s finally in your hands and you have the resources, everything just… disappears.<br>
                    Nothing comes to mind.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Why does that happen?
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    I remember meeting one of my old school friends after a long time.<br>
                    He used to dream of owning a bike. But when he finally bought it,<br>
                    all those feelings he once had seemed to fade away like dust.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Some people — maybe philosophers — call it the <em>"achievement paradox"</em>:<br>
                    You’re excited to achieve something, but once you get it, the joy doesn't feel like you expected.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    But here's the twist — the process of getting there, the journey — that’s where the magic lies.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Just like I enjoyed building this site and deploying it with my own hands.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    I don’t know how I ended up writing all this,<br>
                    but I’ve learned one thing:
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6 font-semibold italic">
                    The paradox of achievement is real.
