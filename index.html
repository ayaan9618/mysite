                i'm just a guy who loves creating things.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                i also love figuring out how stuff works. like, really works.
            </p>

                i'm a second-year computer science student obsessed with quantum physics, fighter jets, startups, and
                all the strange loops inside the human brain.

            <p class="mb-6">
                i discovered 
                <a class="text-blue-500 text-[20px] hover:underline " href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/">cs50</a> in 2023 and fell into coding.<br>
                been building ever since.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                in 2024, i started a coding club at my college with a few people just as crazy as me.<br>
                we built stuff. led things. broke a few too.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                turns out organizing chaos is also kind of fun.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                joined <a class="text-blue-500 text-[20px] hover:underline " href="https://www.ieee.org/">ieee.</a>
                 somehow ended up leading the whole student branch.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                presently doing research and building things in web development. mostly exploring how people use tech,
                and how tech sometimes uses people.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                also kind of obsessed with aviation tech and

                —machines built for precision, chaos, and pushing
                limits.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                i've been coding almost daily—not for the streak, but because it feels like the one thing that makes
                sense when everything else doesn’t.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                i write sometimes. i build often.<br>
                i haven't made anything big—yet.<br>
                but i'm moving. learning. not standing still.<br>
                i'm not built for drifting.
